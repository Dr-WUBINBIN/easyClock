Note: This application is unsigned, so I recommend launching it by "right-clicking" the app in your "Applications folder" for the first time,
and selecting “Open” from the menu. A warning dialog may appear—please click “Open” again to proceed. 
macOS will quarantine and verify the app when it starts, which may take 30–60 seconds.
